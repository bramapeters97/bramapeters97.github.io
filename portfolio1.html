                    <p class="about__description">Online learning has become a strong solution for educational institutions to save money and offer 
                        courses with more flexibility. The use of online learning platforms generates a goldmine of data 
                        on how students navigate the system and progress through their academic studies. A new trend within learning analytics
                        is to use this data to create online learning dashboards. These dashboards give students visual indicators of their study behavior and progress, 
                        helping them reflect and evaluate their study strategies.
                        <br><br>
                        In my <a target="blank" href="https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/design-and-evaluation-of-a-student-facing-learning-dashboard-usin"><b>master thesis project<i class="uil uil-file-alt button__icon"></i></b></a>, I focused on how we can develop a learning dashboard for <a target=”_blank” href="https://www.tue.nl"><b>TU/e's</b></a> Canvas-platform 
                        in a way that is grounded in learning sciences and truly facilitates online learning. Using frameworks from 
                        self-regulated learning theory and students' self-reported needs for specific features, I designed and 
                        implemented a learning dashboard for TU/e's (Eindhoven University of Technology) online learning platform Canvas. The dashboard visualizes academic performance and provides dynamic, course-level 
                        recommendations on how students can improve their learning (i.e., based on aggregate models of clickstream-data 
                        and academic results).<br><br></p>

As you work towards your goals, you monitor your progress and adjust your strategies to improve. After each learning experience, you reflect on how well you did and use that insight to set new goals and improve your learning methods. These skills, like goal-setting and self-assessment, are crucial for academic success and skill development. <br><br>

                                <p class="about__description">Even though many learning dashboards argue the core of their designs to be based on self-regulated learning theory, their implementations differ substantially and yield different cognitive and affective learning outcomes. In my research project, I looked at different implementations of self-regulated learning theory in learning dashboards affect students' thinking and feelings about their learning as well as how they progress academically in the long-term. This study followed a user-centered design approach, using student feedback to shape the dashboard features for each stage of self-regulated learning.</p>

                        <h1 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 18px">Design Process</h1>
                        <p class="about__description"> While many learning dashboard studies consider what students need, only a few actually ask students what they need. Learning dashboards aim to help students learn better, so it makes sense to involve students in the design process. I talked to students at Eindhoven University of Technology and used their input, along with information from previous research, to create a new dashboard for Canvas, the university's learning system.                                     
                            Through an iterative user-centered design process - including several phases of user interviews, creating personas, storytelling, wireframing, and
                        prototyping - I created several designs in AdobeXD that differed in the extent to which they theoretically supported self-regulated learning and 
                        how they met the needs as proposed by students themselves. I then compared and further improved these designs through AB- and usability-testing, and I presented my work to all stakeholders involved in the project continuously while
                        using their feedback to steer course when necessary. <br> <br> Eventually, I implemented the
                        dashboard fully in PowerBI and HTML/CSS/JavaScript using real clickstream data that was generated from students' use of university's learning management system as well as records of their academic progress such as their grades and submissions. Eventually, the dashboard was enrolled for all participating students in one of the university's Bachelor programs. The dashboard used real-time data from students using an Azure Databricks connection and single sign-on with the TU/e's learning management system. The different versions of the dashboard were then evaluated and compared using a variety of usability metrics as well as cognitive and affective learning outcomes.<br><br>

                                        The final version of the TU/e Learning Dashboard focused on improving the self-regulated learning experience for students. To achieve this, data was collected from Canvas, the learning management system at TU/e. This data included clickstream information, grades, submissions, and other relevant indicators, all in pseudonymized format.To make sense of this data and provide students with valuable insights, PowerBI was used to create aggregate tables to streamline the information, including a simplified online activity table and a course results table. Features that were implemented aligned with the different phases of self-regulated learning theory, but designed in a way that met the needs that the students reported themselves.

            <p class="about__description">
                I explored how providing support for all three phases of self-regulated learning in a design 
                affects cognitive and affective learning outcomes differently compared to only supporting the performance phase. By doing so, 
                my goal was to provide targeted design recommendations that could resolve some of the shortcomings in current learning 
                dashboards designs. With the progressive growth of online education, it's becoming increasingly important to design 
                technologies that can facilitate effective learning experiences. And I believe that learning dashboards have 
                a crucial role to play in this regard, helping students access key information about their progress and 
                performance.<br><br>
