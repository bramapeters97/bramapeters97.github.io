                    <p class="about__description">Online learning has become a strong solution for educational institutions to save money and offer 
                        courses with more flexibility. The use of online learning platforms generates a goldmine of data 
                        on how students navigate the system and progress through their academic studies. A new trend within learning analytics
                        is to use this data to create online learning dashboards. These dashboards give students visual indicators of their study behavior and progress, 
                        helping them reflect and evaluate their study strategies.
                        <br><br>
                        In my <a target="blank" href="https://research.tue.nl/en/studentTheses/design-and-evaluation-of-a-student-facing-learning-dashboard-usin"><b>master thesis project</b></a>, I focused on how we can develop a learning dashboard for <a target=”_blank” href="https://www.tue.nl"><b>TU/e's</b></a> Canvas-platform 
                        in a way that is grounded in learning sciences and truly facilitates online learning. Using frameworks from 
                        self-regulated learning theory and students' self-reported needs for specific features, I designed and 
                        implemented a learning dashboard that visualizes academic performance and provides dynamic, course-level 
                        recommendations on how students can improve their learning (i.e., based on aggregate models of clickstream-data 
                        and academic results).</p>

                        <p class="about__description">Through an iterative user-centered design process - including several phases of user interviews, creating personas, storytelling, wireframing, and
                        prototyping - I created several designs in AdobeXD that differed in the extent to which they theoretically supported self-regulated learning and 
                        how they met the needs as proposed by students themselves. I then compared and further improved these designs through AB- and usability-testing, and I presented my work to all stakeholders involved in the project continuously while
                        using their feedback to steer course when necessary. Eventually, I implemented the
                        dashboard fully in PowerBI and HTML/CSS/JavaScript and it was enrolled for all participating students in one of the university's Bachelor programs. The dashboard used real-time data from students using an Azure Databricks connection and single sign-on with the TU/e's learning management system.
                        <br><br>
                        I explored how providing support for all three phases of self-regulated learning in a design 
                        affects cognitive and affective learning outcomes differently compared to only supporting the performance phase. By doing so, 
                        my goal was to provide targeted design recommendations that could resolve some of the shortcomings in current learning 
                        dashboards designs. With the progressive growth of online education, it's becoming increasingly important to design 
                        technologies that can facilitate effective learning experiences. And I believe that learning dashboards have 
                        a crucial role to play in this regard, helping students access key information about their progress and 
                        performance.
