                    <p class="about__description">At student-team Blue Jay, my team and I were committed to creating a drone that can serve as 
                        intelligent companions to assist healthcare workers in their daily tasks. The goal at Blue Jay is 
                        to expand the capabilities of intelligent systems by developing drones that are safe, autonomous, 
                        interactive, and helpful.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p class="about__description">                        
                        As an Interaction Designer, my role was to design a 
                        user-friendly interface that allowed healthcare workers to communicate with the drone intuitively 
                        and without a 
                        traditional controller. I achieved this by implementing a responsive LCD-screen with signaling 
                        eyes, a microphone with speech recognition capabilities, and a camera with emotion detection. 
                        These features enabled healthcare workers to easily control the drone's operations, 
                        even without any prior experience with flying drones. The drone could convey vital information to the user about
                        its operations, 
                        such as whether it had detected an emergency or if a command was processed successfully. 
                        
                        </p>

                    <p class="about__description">Additionally, I developed the Blue Jay App, which simplifies communication between users and drones. 
                        The app allows real-time tracking of drones, easy commands for the drone's operations, and archives all historical 
                        data on emergencies detected by the drone. The Blue Jay App makes it easier for inexperienced users 
                        to interact with drones safely, efficiently, and intuitively.
                    </p>

                    <p class="about__description">                        
                        During 
                            my time at Blue Jay, we worked on many different scenarios to explore the possibilities of using drones 
                            in healthcare and beyond. One of the scenarios we focused on was the use of drones to assist in 
                            time-consuming routine tasks, such as distributing medicines in healthcare facilities. By using drones 
                            for these tasks, healthcare workers could focus more on patient care, and patients would have more time 
                            to interact with workers. However, our focus at Blue Jay was not limited to healthcare 
                        facilities. We also explored how drones could be used as an aid at larger events by detecting
                        medical emergencies and providing means of crowd control.
