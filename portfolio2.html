                  <p class="about__description">At student-team <a target=”_blank” href="https://bluejayeindhoven.nl"><b>Blue Jay</b></a>, my team and I were committed to creating a drone that can assist healthcare workers in their daily tasks and can serve as an
                    an intelligent companion for patients. The goal at Blue Jay is to expand the capabilities of intelligent systems by developing drones that are safe, autonomous, 
                      interactive, and helpful.
                      <br><br>
                      At the time, my role as an <i>Interaction Designer</i> was specifically created to assist the Blue Jay-team 
                      in its early days as a start-up student-team. During my time there, we worked on many 
                      different scenarios to explore the possibilities of using drones in healthcare and beyond. One of the 
                      scenarios we focused on was the use of drones to support nurses in time-consuming routine tasks, 
                      such as distributing medicines in healthcare facilities and doing simple checks. By using drones for these tasks, healthcare
                      workers could focus more on personal patient care, and patients would have more time to interact with workers. 
                      The core underlying idea of Blue Jay is that the drone should be able to do so autonomously, meaning that it should therefore
                      also be able to detect emergencies happening around the facility and report that back to the nurses efficiently and effectively. </p>

                  <div class="about__data">
                      <p class="about__description">This meant that the Blue Jay-drone had to be visibly present and approachable, yet perceived
                        as safe, trustworthy and non-invasive to the personal space and privacy of patients and worker's. That is where my role as an Interaction
                        Designer came in, as we had to innovate and find new ways in which healthcare workers and patients could
                        interact with the drone intuitively and without a traditional controller.
                        My team and I achieved this by installing a dynamic lighting scheme and a responsive LCD-screen with eyes on the drone.
                        The state of the eyes and the lights corresponded to the current state of the drone (e.g., if it was performing a task or 
                        if it was responding to an event it had detected). For example, the drone would turn green and smile at a patient or worker once it had processed
                        a command succesfully and proceeded with executing it. The drone also responded to input from patients through emotion detection
                        and speech recognition using a camera and a microphone.</p>

                        Through an iterative user-centered design process - including several phases of user interviews, creating personas, storytelling, and prototyping - we created different
                        lighting- and 'eye'-schemes for the drone that represented different 'emotional' states for the drone. As part of the conceptualization of these 'emotional states', these 
                        schemes were presented to patients and workers in different scenarios, and through a collaborative process we finetuned
                        the responsiveness of the drone to a large variety of different situations.
                        <br><br>
                        Additionally, I developed the Blue Jay Android-app, which simplifies communication between users and drones. 
                        The app allows real-time tracking of drones, easy commands for the drone's operations, and archives all historical 
                        data on emergencies detected by the drone. The Blue Jay App makes it easier for inexperienced users 
                        to interact with drones safely, efficiently, and intuitively. I tested the Blue Jay using a variety of methods,
                        including think-aloud interviews with healthcare and emergency staff and AB-testing.
