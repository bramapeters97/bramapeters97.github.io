                  For a project at <a href="https://www.kth.se" target="blank"><b>Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH)</b></a> in Stockholm, Sweden, In this project, we employed the Double Diamond framework to revamp Spotify's podcast section. Our design approach was goal-oriented, primarily centered on uncovering and meeting user expectations. The subsequent sections delve into the various phases within the Double Diamond design process and outline the methods we utilized for each phase.<br><br></p>

              <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Think-Aloud and Interviews</h3>
                <p class="about__description">Our project was centered on enhancing the podcast section of Spotify, and Thinking Aloud emerged as the natural choice to delve into users' thought processes and identify pain points within the Spotify user experience.
                  Thinking Aloud also offered the advantage of evaluating design perception without disrupting the user's thought process, in contrast to other evaluation methods like cooperative evaluations. Moreover, this method was straightforward to set up, time-efficient, and cost-effective, aligning well with our project goals and task limitations.              
                  <br><br>
                  Our approach involved an initial interview to establish a baseline understanding of users, followed by Think Aloud tests, where one team member conducted the interview while another recorded and took notes. This collaborative approach ensured a smooth testing process and comprehensive note-taking during the Think Aloud sessions. We were able to explore users' podcast listening habits, their preferences for other podcast applications, and their specific pain points while using Spotify. These interviews provided valuable insights into their decision-making processes, making it clear why they chose Spotify or not. <br><br>

              <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Affinity Diagram</h3>
                <p class="about__description">As a first step in any project with the aim to improve a product, a thorough understanding of
                  the issue needs to be presented. After gathering the data (user interviews, observations and
                  literature review) from the discovery phase we needed to find a way to get to know our data
                  and analyze the findings with the primary goal of making sense of both the challenges and
                  possibilities. The affinity diagram was chosen in order to avoid making the common error of
                  assuming users' perception of the problem without taking the time and examining the
                  supporting data to provide more insight into the issue we are trying to solve.</p>

                </div>
                <p class="about__description">The second phase of the double diamond design process should end with a well defined
                problem statement which the affinity diagram helped to form. Despite the fact that the
                interviews and observations revealed many aspects of Spotify that might be improved, the
                most common pain points all refer back
                to the most important user goal. That is, to be able to explore
                Spotify's podcast section quickly and easily. This includes the user's desire to be in
                command, their need to know where they are in the system, and their ability to navigate
                intuitively and recover from errors with the fewest possible steps. Within every problem there lies an opportunity for design. The insights gathered from the
                affinity diagram helped us identify design requirements. By reframing the challenges as a
                problem statement and ‘How might we’ statements we could set ourselves up for more
                innovative solutions.<br><br>

              <h3 style="font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif; font-size: 14px">Brain Writing</h3>
                <p class="about__description">Brainwriting was an innovative idea generation method in which participants added their
                  own ideas to those of others. The method is very simple and fast and can be learned easily
                  and quickly. The project needed to generate ideas for the podcast section based on the
                  Problem Statement and ‘How might we’ which were defined in the definition phase. It was
                  important to first diverge ideas and have a wide range of options in order to select a more
                  appropriate solution.
                  Brainwriting allows us to generate diverse and creative ideas by combining ideas within the
                  group. By dividing the time and focusing on the work as individuals, everyone can consider
                  ideas equally. Also, by referring to each other's ideas, higher quality ideas can be generated.
                  These ideas can then be used as a group to determine what final improvements can be
                  made total of four rounds were scheduled, each with five minutes to circulate ideas. In each round, one of the group members built onto the ideas of the others. <br><br></p>
                <p class="about__description">The brainwriting sessions yielded two key findings. First, the Spotify interface needs reorganization, with suggestions in each round to separate music and podcasts, improve visual cues, and simplify the design. Second, issues related to icon visibility and page transitions were addressed with proposals to consolidate functions, provide tutorials, prioritize content, and introduce social navigation features. Each round generated more specific ideas for improvement.<br><br>

                <p class="about__description">To assess the prototype's usability, efficiency, and effectiveness, cooperative evaluation was chosen as the formative evaluation method to gather immediate user feedback. This approach involved users performing tasks related to the prototype's core functionality while providing feedback on their thought process and interactions. The dynamic and interactive nature of this method allowed for in-depth discussions, clarifications, and alternative suggestions during the evaluation process.<br><br></p>
                <p class="about__description">Users positively responded to the separation of music and podcast sections in the prototype, appreciating the toggle button and layout separation. However, they had questions and concerns about the social navigation component, leading to design improvements, such as the introduction of sub-tabs within the community section.
                  The mood personalization feature was well-received for its intuitiveness and ease of use. Users also provided insights into its potential enhancements, such as expanding mood coverage and applying mood filtering in search and library tabs.<br><br></p>

                <p class="about__description"> After successfully completing the double-diamond stages, we are proud to unveil our final Spotify interface prototype. Our project aimed to enhance the Spotify Podcast section based on user research during the discovery phase, which highlighted the need for improved navigation and control.                 The final prototype includes Home, Community, Library, and Search screens, each with Podcast and Music versions. The Home screen features mood-based recommendations, while the Community screen includes Activity and Following sections. The Library and Search screens have layouts tailored for Podcasts.
                  We developed three key strategies: <br><br>
                <ol>
                  <li><b>Layout Enhancement:</b> We refined the user interface to clearly distinguish between Spotify's Music and Podcast sections.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Social Navigation:</b> Users can now interact and follow others for personalized content recommendations, making navigation more intuitive.
                  </li>
                  <li><b>Mood Personalization:</b> We integrated mood-based content discovery, allowing users to find content that matches their current mood and preferences, including recommendations from others.
